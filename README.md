This lab is based on the previous lab ‘chit-chat-rooms’. It is now deployed from the AWS control panel(GIU) as well as deployed using eb deploy through the cli.

#### Issues

Originally I had an issue with getting the first link to deploy. I didn’t have time to go back and redeploy the link, but I realised the reason it wasn’t working in the first place was because I forgot one of the files when I went to zip them up.
